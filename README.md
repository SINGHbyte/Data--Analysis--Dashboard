## Project Process (1 Paragraph)

I downloaded the Zomato dataset from Kaggle, cleaned it in Excel by removing duplicates, fixing missing values, and standardizing country and cuisine names. Then I prepared the data by creating new fields like rating categories and grouping key values. Using this cleaned dataset, I built pivot tables to analyze restaurant count, online delivery, table booking, cuisines, ratings, and customer votes. Next, I created visualizations such as bar, column, and donut charts, added interactive slicers, and designed a clean dashboard layout. Finally, I interpreted the insights to understand cuisine popularity, customer behavior, and market trends.
